                <p class="text-lg"><strong>Q:</strong> Are you a “doggie day-care”<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> We have day-time regulars, who sometimes play together, pending their disposition and size/age balance.
                     HHK’s first and foremost priority is to keep all clients SAFE!
                    Some dogs can be unpredictable and we do not socialize clients because of potential risk.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-lg"><strong>Q:</strong> Do you board all breeds?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Yes, we do not breed-discriminate. However, if your dog weighs over 45lbs, HHK requires a free, trial (4-hour) stay. 
                    If your dog is hostile and/or aggressive toward other animals and/or humans, HHK will not board the dog. 
                    If your dog exhibits stressed, unpredicted behaviors not noted by owner, we will not board the dog.
